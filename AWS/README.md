# AWS VPC Management Script

## üìÑ Description
This is a simple Bash script that, when provided with a command line argument, creates or destroys a VPC and subnet in AWS.

The script:
- Verifies AWS CLI installation and configuration
- Creates a VPC and subnet with custom CIDR ranges
- Tags the resources
- Deletes the VPC and subnet when needed

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites
- AWS CLI must be installed and configured with proper credentials.  
  (Run `aws configure` if not already set up.)

- Necessary IAM permissions to:
  - Create and delete VPCs
  - Create and delete subnets
  - Manage resource tags

---

| Variable      | Description                                   | Default Value     |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| `VPC_CIDR`    | CIDR block for the VPC                        | `10.0.0.0/16`     |
| `SUBNET_CIDR` | CIDR block for the Subnet                     | `10.0.1.0/24`     |
| `REGION`      | AWS Region to deploy the resources            | `us-east-1` (default) |
| `VPC_NAME`    | Name tag assigned to the VPC                  | `MyVPC`           |
| `SUBNET_NAME` | Name tag assigned to the Subnet               | `MySubnet`        |

---

## üöÄ Usage

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x aws_vpc.sh
```

### Create VPC and Subnet
```bash
./aws_vpc.sh create [region]
```
- `region` is optional (defaults to `us-east-1` if not provided).

**Example:**
```bash
./aws_vpc.sh create us-west-2
```

### Destroy VPC and Subnet
```bash
./aws_vpc.sh destroy [region]
```

**Example:**
```bash
./aws_vpc.sh destroy us-west-2
```

---

## ‚úÖ Output
When you **create** resources, you'll see:
- VPC ID
- Subnet ID
- Resource Names
- CIDR details
- Region

When you **destroy** resources, you'll see:
- Deletion confirmation for Subnet and VPC

---

## üìå Notes
- The script searches for VPC and Subnet using their `Name` tags when deleting.
- Error handling is included to catch common failures (like missing AWS CLI, invalid credentials, etc.).
